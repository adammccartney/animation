## Notes on maxpatch

Hopefully the patch is pretty straight forward -> it is a basic sample player
that enables the playing of 15 different samples. The samples are grouped into
two modes. The modes are named "j" and "k". The samples are numbered from 0-9.
To access the first sample in the "j" mode:

1. Press the letter "j" on your keyboard.
2. Press the number "1" on your keyboard.

The samples are a bit "rough and ready", i.e. I didn't try to get trim them
into perfectly loopable segments. Nor did I worry too much about pops and
clicks. Instead I rely on you the performer to add a layer of dynamics as they
are notated in the score.

That's pretty much it. Have fun.
